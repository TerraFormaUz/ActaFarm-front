# ActaFarm Frontend

Welcome to the ActaFarm frontend repository! This repository contains the frontend codebase for ActaFarm, the online community platform for farmers, developed using Angular.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: ActaFarm frontend is built using Angular, a popular framework for building single-page web applications.
- **Angular CLI**: Angular CLI is used for project scaffolding, development, and building processes, providing a streamlined workflow for Angular projects.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is the primary language used for writing Angular code, offering static typing and modern JavaScript features.
- **Karma and Protractor**: Karma and Protractor are used for running unit tests and end-to-end tests, ensuring the reliability and quality of the frontend application.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the ActaFarm frontend on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the ActaFarm frontend repository to your local machine.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TerraFormaUz/ActaFarm-front.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Development Server**: Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

4. **Code Scaffolding**: Use `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

5. **Build**: Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

6. **Unit Tests**: Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via Karma.

7. **End-to-End Tests**: Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.
